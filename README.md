This is a tool used for extracting frames from an HTML5 video element and creating a frame-by-frame player in HTML5 Canvas with some extra tools. This is meant to be used for animated charts or other data-driven gifs to allow for frame-by-frame analysis as well as easy-to-use variable playback speeds. Written as a side-project to learn [ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html).
